# # Using BLS' CPI Microdata
Semi-automated tool to analyze inflation dynamics every time BLS releases new data

The 'CPI wrangler' notebook works with the non-SA data output from the BLS' 'MultiScreen' query tool (https://www.bls.gov/data/home.htm)

The overall goal is to make the output more understandable by including weight, description and aggregation tree indicators plus adding functionality to slice and chart the data
